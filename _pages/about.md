<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently an undergrad in School of Computer Science and Technology, South China University of Technology. I am honored to be advised by [Prof. Yue-Jiao Gong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Mi0Zu3IAAAAJ), and fortunate to work closely with [Zeyuan Ma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Jcy8wPgAAAAJ&hl=en) and Hongshu Guo. We co-founded [GMC-DRL](https://gmc-drl.github.io/) research team aiming to make further exploration in Meta-Black-Box optimization.

I was an [SURF](https://www.sfp.caltech.edu/undergraduate-research/programs/surf) fellow in [Computing + Mathematical Sciences (CMS)](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/) Department at Caltech, where I am honored to be advised by [Prof. Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com/) and [Dr. Kaiyu Yang](https://yangky11.github.io/) and work on AI4Math research project.

My research interest includes two main directions.
- **Meta-Black-Box optimization** (Decision making process under uncertainty). Traditional black box optimization methods replies on intensive labour tuning to achieve required performance especially when applying to new tasks. Meta-Black-Box optimization is generally to mitigates the labour-intensive development in traditional black-box optimization algorithms through meta-learning. (e.g. leverage learning-based methods to automatically deside the most suitable configuration of some black-box optimization algorithms.) The decision making process in Meta-Black-Box optimization is under uncertainty due to the intrinsic randomness in black-box optimization.
- **Formal Theorem Proving** (Decision making process under certainty). Compared to informal one, formal theorem proving usually use proof assistants such as Coq, Isabelle, and Lean. The correctness of formal proofs can be conveniently verified by these proof assitants. Thereforce, decision making process in formal theorem proving allows no mistakes to reach the goal.

[**Project**](https://github.com/GMC-DRL/MetaBox) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- We released a benchmark platform for Meta-Black-Box Optimization named MetaBox. We integrate three different testsuits, about 20 baselines including traditional black-box methods and Meta-Black-Box methods, and new evaluation metrics tailored for Meta-Black-Box optimization. The codebase can be found here.

[SYMBOL: Generating Flexible Black-Box Optimizers through Symbolic Equation Learning](https://iclr.cc/virtual/2024/poster/17539)

**Jiacheng Chen**\*, Zeyuan Ma\*, Hongshu Guo, Yining Ma, Jie Zhang, Yue-Jiao Gong.

[**Project**](https://github.com/GMC-DRL/Symbol) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- Unlike previous methods incrementally auto-configuring some existing black-box algortithms, SYMBOL directly generate stepwise update rule in the form of symbolic eqution to achieve more flexible and interpretable optimization behaviour.

[Auto-configuring Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoff in Evolutionary Computation via Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08239)

Zeyuan Ma\*, **Jiacheng Chen**\*, Hongshu Guo, Yining Ma, Yue-Jiao Gong.

<!-- [**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong> -->
- We explore about how to make a trade-off between exploration and exploitation in Black-Box optimization through learn-based method. In this work, we carefully designed a framework which is based on transfromer-based model and leverage exploration-exploitation related feature tailored for black-box optimization scenario to resolve this problem.

[Neural Exploratory Landscape Analysis](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2408.10672)

- We developed an Neural-Network based lanscape analyser to replace the feature-extracting parts in Meta-Black-Box works which is usually manually designed. To ensure the generalization ability of the NeurELA, we let it operate in Multi-task setting and use neuroevolution to train it.

- We propose to fine-tune language model to generate executable code that can be used for optimization tasks. We proposed a dataset that containing diversed optimization problems and corresponding algorithm in this paper, also leverage some tricks during training process and finally provided a fine-tuned LM for optimization tasks.
